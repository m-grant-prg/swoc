Development is performed under Debian stable and a new branch is created at the
time that stable changes to a new release. Such branches are only maintained
from a security / bug fix perspective; active development continues only under
the tip branch.

Mention below of Fedora, openSUSE and Ubuntu releases show the releases
supported by this branch subject to the EOL date. They compile and build but may
produce build warnings, development focus is Debian.
