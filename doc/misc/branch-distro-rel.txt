Development is performed under Debian stable and a new branch is created at the
time that stable changes to a new release. Such branches are only maintained
from a security / bug fix perspective; active development continues only under
the tip branch.
Old stable branches cease maintenance at the EOL dates shown below.

Mention below of Fedora, openSUSE and Ubuntu releases show the branch used, they
compile and build but may produce build warnings, development focus is Debian.
