Some notes pertaining to an AutoTools installation.

ldconfig
========
Having installed shared libraries it is necessary to run ldconfig to refresh
links and cache. This cannot be automatically included in the installation as it
will cause downstream package builds to fail when trying to access files (/etc)
outside their chroot. It is easier to ask that this be run manually after 'make
install'.
