Testing daemon message processing
=================================

Building should include these flags, -d and -s for debug and sparse. You
probably do not want to build with the at-only flag as you probably want the
daemon under manual control, not under systemd.

You may well want to start the daemon with the -D debug flag. This prevents
daemonisation and prints useful buffer and message information to stdout.
Depending on what needs to be accomplished the daemon can be started in the
following ways:-
Basic
	./swocserverd -D

Valgrind
	libtool --mode=execute valgrind --leak-check=yes --track-origins=yes \
		./swocserverd -D

GDB
Find the device name of the terminal you want to attach to for program output.
	tty
	and use the output below
	libtool --mode=execute gdb --tui --tty=/dev/pts/2 \
		--args ./swocserverd --debug

To send messages to the daemon you can telnet into it:
	telnet localhost 127.0.0.1
	Ctrl ] to break to command prompt
	mode character
	;

The mode character is so that no extraneous CR or LF characters are sent to the
daemon.
The final ; is to basically flush stuff already sent to the daemon by
terminating the message, (which will return an error which can be ignored).
Now you can just type the message. It is a bit ugly as there is no echo of
characters typed and it all just appears as one long line, but it works.
