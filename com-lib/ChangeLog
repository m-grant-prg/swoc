2018-03-07 v 1.0.4 Mark Grant <m.grant.prg@gmail.com>
	*  In the try and if necessary retry routine, do not sleep if bind or
	connect are successful. That would block the address for a full second,
	(an eternity).
	Keep global variables acquired from the config file unchanged
	throughout.

2018-03-06 v 1.0.3 Mark Grant <m.grant.prg@gmail.com>
	*  When establishing a TCP connection, another client or server comms
	session could be taking place. Therefore allow bind and connect 10 tries
	if the address is in use.

2018-02-27 v 1.0.2 Mark Grant <m.grant.prg@gmail.com>
	*  Add SSH support.
	Add Doxygen comments.
	Overhaul of AutoTools project structure.

2017-05-05 v 1.0.0 Mark Grant <m.grant.prg@gmail.com>
	*  Initial release.
