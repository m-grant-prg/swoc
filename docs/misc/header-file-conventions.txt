Internal
========
Internal header files can have any name due to the current directory lookup
of "".

API
===
If headers are installed in includedir the name should be as unique as possible
due to the large potential for name clashes, namespacing would help.

If headers are installed in pkgincludedir and a pkg-config file is supplied
then the situation is like the above since the pkg-config file supplies the
compiler with the Cflags of pkgincludedir. So, the compiler command line will
have both -I${includedir} and -I${pkgincludedir} making a large pool.

If headers are installed in pkgincludedir and all #includes use
${PACKAGE}/example.h then the names can be anything.
