Some notes pertaining to an AutoTools installation.

ldconfig
========
Having installed shared libraries it is necessary to run ldconfig to refresh
links and cache. This cannot be automatically included in the installation as it
will cause downstream package builds to fail when trying to access files (/etc)
outside their chroot. It is easier to ask that this be run manually after 'make
install'.


doc-base documentation
======================
This package produces documentation designed to be registered with scrollkeeper
and dochelp. The problem arises when it is required to have an AT installation
and a package manager installation residing in parallel. In the case of doc-base
this would mean installing 2 sets of documentation with the same docid. Needless
to say doc-base does not like this.

The solution is not to automatically install the doc-base documents unless
specifically asked to do so with the --enable-atonly argument supplied to
configure.
