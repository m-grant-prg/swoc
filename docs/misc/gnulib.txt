gnulib interaction
==================
The initial gnulib setup is performed by the script gen-gnulib.sh located in the
project root directory. See the script itself for more information. For this
project, invoking it from the project root directory would take the form:-
	./gen-gnulib.sh . configmake

Files in src/prg/c/gen/inc are not tracked in git but those in m4 and
src/prg/c/gen/lib are. This allows people to work from a source tarball or a git
clone without having to install gnulib and running gnulib-tool. It also enables
straight forward builds of the project in packaging environments such as;
pbuilder and LaunchPad, and, osc and openSUSE Build Service.
This is described as option 3 on:-
	https://www.gnu.org/software/gnulib/manual/html_node/VCS-Issues.html

The bootstrap.sh script has a -g option which will perform a:-
	gnulib-tool --update
	based on gnulib-cache.m4 if you have gnulib installed.

The gnulib files committed are updated by the repo owner from the latest
version he has installed.
