gnulib interaction
==================
The initial gnulib setup is performed by the command:-
	gnulib-tool --import --source-base=src/prg/c/gen/lib \
		--no-conditional-dependencies --no-libtool configmake

Files generated by the configmake modules are not tracked in git but the m4
macros in the m4 directory are. This allows people to work from a source tarball
or a git clone without having to install gnulib and running gnulib-tool.
This is described as option 3 on:-
	https://www.gnu.org/software/gnulib/manual/html_node/VCS-Issues.html

The bootstrap.sh script has a -g option which will perform a:-
	gnulib-tool --update	# If you have gnulib installed.

The gnulib files committed are updated by the repo owner from the latest
version he has installed.
