# This .gitignore file is to ensure that this directory exists even though
# none of it's contents will ever be tracked. This is required because
# otherwise, after cloning, the project build will fail citing this missing
# directory.
# In other words, this is a git hack to satisfy AutoTools.

# Ignore everything ...
