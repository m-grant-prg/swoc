NAME
swc_client_wait(cnumlocks) - Wait until this client has cnumlocks or less locks
on the server.
SYNOPSIS
#include <swoc/libswocclient.h>

int swc_client_wait(char *cnumlocks);
DESCRIPTION
The swc_client_wait function reads the swoc.conf configuration file and
continually queries the server for client locks. Once cnumlocks or fewer locks
exist it exits. Only values of 0 or 1 make any sense. Typically an earlier
command would have set a lock.
.br
mge_errno is set on error.
PARAMETERS
cnumlocks - a pointer to a string holding the maximum number of locks to wait
for. Valid values are 0 or 1.
RETURN VALUE
0 on success.
.br
-mge_errno on failure
ERRORS
mge_errno will be set on error as follows:-
.br
MGE_PARAM if the supplied parameter is < 0, > 1 or contains an invalid
character.

Set to the error incurred in a called function.

Set to the error returned in the message from the server or if an error is not
supplied then MGE_INVAL_MSG is returned.
EXAMPLE
A simple example would be:-
.br
swocclient --lock ; swocclient --wait=1 ; swocclient --release ; shutdown -P now
