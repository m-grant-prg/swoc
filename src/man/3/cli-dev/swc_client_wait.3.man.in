NAME
swc_client_wait(cnumlocks) - Wait until this client has cnumlocks or less locks
on the server.
SYNOPSIS
#include <libswocclient.h>

int swc_client_wait(char *cnumlocks);
DESCRIPTION
The swc_client_wait function reads the swoc.conf configuration file and
continually queries the server for client locks. Once cnumlocks or fewer locks
exist it exits. Only values of 0 or 1 make any sense.
Typically an earlier command would have set a lock.
PARAMETERS
cnumlocks - a pointer to a string holding the maximum number of locks to wait
for. Valid values are 0 or 1.
RETURN VALUE
0 on success.
.br
Non-zero Failure
EXAMPLE
A simple example would be:-
.br
swocclient --lock ; swocclient --wait=1 ; swocclient --release ; shutdown -P now
